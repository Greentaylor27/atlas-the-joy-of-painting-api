learning ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)


## ERD model

## Instructions

To explain how to work this and what the intention was since I never finished

1. run Cleanup.py (this is the extract step where I pull all the data I need out of each of the CSVs)

2. Run Connect.py (This was intended to be the point at which we make the junction table in a CSV format to have a hard copy as well as to the database)

this is where I explain the intention:

3. Run Import.py (This step was intended to send all the CSVs to the database (PostgreSQL) I ended up changing architectures mid way through the project)

4. Run all the connecting backend to be able to filter and post what you need

## Pitfalls

So I feel this section is needed as this project never got finished.

1. Sitting down to draft the ERD diagram for how the tables will layout

2. How to connect the tables. (purpose of this project really)

3. Picking which database archietecture to use (I ended up changing about half way through)
